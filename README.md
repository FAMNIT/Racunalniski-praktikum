# CP1preps
resources, scripts and other materials for CP1 

## File Organization

Resources and lessons are found in folders with name "Bash", "LaTEX" and "C". Students can freely access these resources for their convenience. 

Submissions are to be put in the folder with the name "Student Works". A folder with the username of the student should be made and their respective submissions must be put in that folder. 

For example, if the username is "jrdndj" then there should be a jrdndj folder inside Student Works. 

## WARNING

You may only contribute to your folders unless you have been explicitly told to do so (for example: in pair or programming exercises).
