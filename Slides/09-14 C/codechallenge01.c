allow the user to input a float number (hint: instead of %d, use %f for scanf. then for printf use %.2f)
assume that the values input is in degree celsius
the program will then print its equivalent value in degree fahrenheit and in degree Kelvin
you may google the formula but the code to convert it must be written by you. 
print all three values.
