Code challenge for RIN-EN-G1

Create a C program that performs the following task:
> receive two integer inputs from the user
> print the sum, difference, product and quotient of the two integers
> use user-defined functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
> use local variables
> however you cannot use the * and / operators anywhere in the program

Hint: multiplication is repeated addition. division is repeated subtraction.

Code challenge for RIN-EN-G2

Create a C program that performs the following task: 
> receive an array of 5 numbers from the user
> print the maximum and minimum values in the array
> print the average of the values in the array
> use user-defined functions
> use local variables

Code challenge for BF

Create a C Program that performs the following task: 
> ask the user to input two c-strings 
> check if the two strings should have the same number of characters. if not, ask the user to enter another input c string. 
> once accepted, check if the two strings are anagrams. 
> use user-defined functions, local variables. 

Hint: An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once

Code challenge for MA

Create a C Program that performs the following task:
> receive an integer input from the user
> check if the integer input is a 3 digit integer. ask for another one if it is not. 
> check if the input is an Armstrong number. 
> sample input: 371
> sample output: The number 371 is an armstrong number. 

Hint: Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3.

Code challenge for RIN-EN-G3

Create a C program with functions that performs the following task: 
> receive an input string from the user. this will be used as the name of a hero character.
> receive number input from the user. this will be used to get attributes of the hero. use this function to get the strength, intelligence, agility values of the user. 
> compute for the HITPOINTS of the hero based on their strength value. value is strength x 21. print it. 
> compute for the MANAPOINTS of the hero based on their int value. value is intel x 19. print it. 
> compute for the DAMAGE REDUCED FACTOR of the hero based on their agi value. value is agi x 0.2. print it. 
> for the previous 3 compute values, use only one function to 2 parameters: the attribute and the multiplier. return the value and print it. 
> use functions. the multiplication symbol should only be used once in this entire program!
> use local variables and parameter passing.
