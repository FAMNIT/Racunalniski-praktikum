15 jan 2021 Midterms 2 

1500-1700 time of exam

60% Midterms (each midterm should be at least 30%, the average of both should be at least 50%)
40% Homeworks (you need at least two homeworks, drop the lowest grade)
4 homeworks, 1 bash, 1 latex, 2 c, your lowest homework will be "forgotten"

basis for grading
0	49.99	0
50	64.99	6
65	74.99	7
75	84.99	8
85	94.99	9
95	100		10

Multidimensional Arrays
Array of Records/Structures
LinkedLists 

Complex Data Structures (not data types) 
BF, MA, RIN

MD Arrays - matrices, vectors, 

| | | | | | | array is a list

we work with 2D arrays 

2D array = X * y array (matrix)

type arrayName[x][y] 

int arr6x3[6][3]

  0 1 2
0 - - - 
1 - - - 
2 - - - 
3 - - -
4 - - -
5 - - - 

!help 

especially in image processing (photos) 

RGB = red green blue 

every image has a pixel, resolution dpi (dot per inch)

if you want to prcess these images you will use matrices or vectors 

if you need to reference the elements in the array you refer to the specific point in the matrix/table 

arr6x3[3][2] = 1;

2Dimension C-string array 

recall: C-string is your array of characters

sWord[4] = {'w', 'o', 'r', 'd'};

that means we can also have 2D strings 

sWord[10][4]; // we have 10 sets of 4-character c-strings 

a "dictionary" of n-character words 

for 2 dimensional arrays, to recall

in 1D/regular arrays we use for loop/while one loop to "traverse" through the elements


if we use 2D arrays, then we use 2 for loops in our arrays 


Array of Records (Array of Structure) 

when we defined records/structures we are talking about defining a "new type" 
if we have an array of records, then we have the list of the same "new type"

struct students{
	int dID;
	char sFName[20];
	char sLanme[20];
	char sProgram[15];

} bf[15], ma[4], rin[30];


saving the data is the same in such a way that we just add the [] in it

bf[0].id=5;
bf[0].sFName = "Jovan";


bf[] = list or a record of bf students 

what you want to do is ify ou want to pass the array of records

what you can do is have a point of a struct students type
and the function receives the struct students* 

the problem with array of records is when we define them we already limit the size of the memory allocated to the computer


Linked Lists

& address
* pointer 

struct students{
	int dID;
	char sFName[20];
	char sLanme[20];
	char sProgram[15];
	struct students *next; 

} bf, ma, rin; 

bf.next= &ma;  // this is not the proper way to reference or access the element
bf->next = &ma; //this is the proper way to reference 


These are complex data structures that lets you manage "large" data in groups 
Multidimensional Arrays = table, matrix, image data, encryption
Array of records = 
Linkedlists = records, databases 

relational databases (SQL, etc) = array of records, linkedlists 
noSQL (Json, MongoDB) = linkedlists

Linkedlists = singly, doubly, circular
traversal
graphs, stacks, queues
