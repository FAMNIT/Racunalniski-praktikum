#include<stdio.h>
^ hash/pound/hashtag include
 <stdio.h>
  ^ standard input output header (.h) its a header file 
  you should be able to use standard print and input methods

  the standard print method in c is called printf

  printf("Hello World");
  ^printf command
         ^ it is receiving a parameter
         " " > we call this a literal
                       ^ semi-colon ; end of instruction

int main(){

}
main is the primary function
keyword int, main is a function and it "returns" someting of type integer

3+4 = 7
function returns 7
int main() is a function that returns something of integer type

\n escape sequence, telling the compiler to create a newline



the computer uses machine language (low level programming language) binary language 10's

we humans use natural/high level language
make me a sandwich

the computer and the human cannot understand each other 

in order for them to understand each other we need an translator (interpreter)

when we compile a program (such as .c) we are translating that program for the computer to understand



for basics:

if using windows (terminal/command prompt)
open terminal
go to the location of your file for example Desktop
> cd Desktop

if you using gcc then we use the
> gcc filename.c

Windows gcc creates an object file and this object file becomes an executable (.exe)

filename.o (filename.obj) filename.exe

>filename 
>filename.exe

>gcc hello.c
> hello
Hello World! 

if using Mac/Unix/Linux (terminal )
> gcc filename.c
> ./a.out
Hello World!

Visual Studio/Dev C/CodeBlocks IDE
>Compile>Build>Run/Test

you should be able to run these c programs natively 

for Windows users 
#include<conio.h>

getch();
getche();

//may not work for unix based system
