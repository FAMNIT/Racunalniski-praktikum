Week 09 notes

arithmetic operators

binary operators

 + - * /

 if statements

 conditional operators (binary)

 condition and an outcome depending on the condition

 if the input number is a prime number, do something
 if it is not, do something else 

 < less than
 <= less than or equal (happy face)
 > greater than
 >= greater than or equal (sad face)

 = assignment operator
 == is equal to
 != is not equal to

  && logical AND (ampersand)
  || logical OR (pipe) 
  to mix and match multiple conditions

 how do we input a number that is a 3 digit number?

hungarian notation 

	dUserInput
	 ^
	  descriptive name for the identifier (camelcase) 
	^data type %d

	fvalueofPi
	 ^
	^ %f

condition statements 
  IF statement
  if (<condition>){
  	//do something if true
  }
  
  IF-else statement
  if (<condition>){
  	//do something if true
  }
  else {
    // do something if not true 
  }
  //something else here 

  If-ELSE-IF statement
  if (<condition>){
  	//do something if true
  }
  else {
    if (<condition>){
  	//do something if true
  	}//endif
  	else {
    // do something if not true 
  	} //endifelseelse
  }

  IF-ELSE-ELSE
  if(condition){
  	//do something here
  }
  else if(condition){
  	//do something ehere
  }
  else{
  	//do something 
  }

  how do we know if a number is divisible by n

  is 4 divisible by 2? 

  if there is no remainder then it is divisible

  modulo (plural), modulus (single) returns the remainder

  n / m quotient
  n % m remainder

  remainder = n % m 
  then do an if statement 

  #define CHECKER_NUM 6
  ^ 6 is permanently assigned to checker

  constant int CHECKER_NUM = 6;

  CodeChallenge 2

  A C program that will allow the user to input integers. The integer input can be a 2,3 or 4-digit integer. Reject if it is a 1 digit integer. Reject if it is 5-digits or more. 
  Integers must be positive. 
  If the integer has "23" in it, print "Jordan"
  If the integer has "24" in it, print "Kobe"
  Else, print "useless". 

  23 Jordan
  24 Kobe
  1024 Kobe
  5231 Jordan
  2400 Kobe
  5555 useless
  55 useless
  555 useless

  ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten-thousands
